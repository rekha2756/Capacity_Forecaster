# 🚀 IM-02 AI Capacity Forecaster

An AI-powered Streamlit dashboard that forecasts CPU, Memory, and Disk utilization using **Prophet and ARIMA models**, with built-in anomaly detection and risk analysis.

The system helps organizations predict future capacity usage, detect abnormal behavior, and avoid infrastructure bottlenecks.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

Modern infrastructure systems require proactive capacity planning to avoid performance degradation.

This project solves this by:

- Forecasting resource utilization trends
- Detecting anomalies in forecast behavior
- Identifying when thresholds will be breached
- Providing AI-driven insights for decision-making

---

# ✨ Features

## 📊 AI Forecasting Engine

Supports two forecasting models:

- Prophet (time-series forecasting)
- ARIMA (statistical forecasting)

Forecasts:

- CPU Usage
- Memory Usage
- Disk Usage

---

## 🔍 AI Query System

Users can ask natural language questions like:

- When will CPU usage hit 80%?
- Predict Disk usage growth
- Forecast Memory utilization

System automatically detects the metric (CPU / Memory / Disk).

---

## 🚨 Anomaly Detection

Built-in logic detects abnormal patterns:

- Rolling mean deviation (Prophet)
- Statistical deviation (ARIMA)
- Forecast instability detection

---

## 📈 Risk Analysis

Automatically classifies system health:

- 🟢 Low Risk → Safe usage
- 🟠 Medium Risk → Approaching threshold
- 🔴 High Risk → Exceeds capacity limit

---

## 📥 Export Feature

Download full forecast results as CSV:

- Forecast dates
- Predicted values
- Anomaly flags

---

## 🧠 AI Insights Panel

Provides intelligent explanations for:

- CPU behavior
- Memory usage patterns
- Disk growth trends
- Forecast anomalies
